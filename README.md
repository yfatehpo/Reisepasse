--------------

Reisepasse is a blog and online library run by Yoni and Yousef. 

We have a primary goal: To deliver important literary and philosophical texts in an accessible format, alongside new book covers, and introductions written by avid fans of said works. 

We operate as a cultural blog as well, sharing our opinions, hosting guest writers, and promoting independent artists of all fields.
