        <h1>5/8/20</h1>
        <h2 style="color: crimson;">Relax.</h2>
        <p>by Yousef Fatehpour</p>
        <p>Kendrick Lamar's legacy has hosted a looming question for years since the rapper claimed
            prodigy status: "what could he possibly do next?" Some felt as if <em>Good Kid m.A.A.d City</em> served as a 
            peak. In fact, much of the initial rection to his 2015 follow up, <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, was marked 
            by general shock and kudos that he <em>actually followed up!</em> And so it's no surprise that <em>Damn.'s (?)</em>
            strange & young legacy diverges for so many.

            <br><br>

            In the critical sphere, the album, for the most part, upheld high praise. But Pitchfork's 9.2 score, alongside their
            video entitled "Kendrick Lamar's <em>Damn.</em> is an INSTANT CLASSIC", seem to have represented a different reality
            from the average listener. In fact, that same video has a 1:7 dislike ratio, with the top three comments either 
            immediately retorting to <em>Damn.</em> being his worst album; good, but not better than his last; or an "instant light 7", 
            an allusion to Anthony Fantano's now infamous score for the project. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            There is a general anger in the air when it comes to discussing the album. Would chalkboardmusic, the 110 year old
            Male user on rateyourmusic, who handed <em>South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut</em> a perfect five star rating really
            rather listen to rapper 6ix9ine than this project? Just two reviews below him, we find when2areinlove, unspecified gender,
            about 91 years younger than chalkboardmusic, claiming "it just genuinely rubs me the wrong way. feels vapid and self-indulgent. 
            i hate it when celebrities make themselves into gods, and this is what i feel like he tried to do here."
            </p>

            <p>

            "This is maybe one of the most tonally inconsistent and sloppy major albums I've ever heard."

            <br><br>

            "HUMBLE is actually a headache to listen to, DNA is really dumb, GOD has some of the worst vocal deliveries I've heard from Kendrick Lamar. XXX feels less and less prevalent as time passes."

            <br><br>

            "Aged like Milk"

            <br><br>

            Damn. One hopes it's mere lack of sleep that leads people to believe songs about black bodies dying have aged like milk.
            </p>
            <p>

            It's dishonest to reject the understandable nature of it all. There are a few unexplained sore spots 
            in the project, the most stark ones being <em>LOYALTY., HUMBLE.,</em> & <em>LOVE.</em> And although I've found
            myself flat-out rejecting those songs...they're OK.

            <br><br>

            Still, the placement of such outwardly "mainstream" songs on an album this deep in Kendrick's career is just strange.
            It seems that prior to <em>Damn.</em>, singles like <em>i</em> or <em>Backseat Freestyle</em> were justified 
            in the context of the albums they respectively preceded. Where do songs like <em>LOYALTY.</em> fall? Especially considering the
            final question Kendrick throws out before ending the fourth song on the album, <em>ELEMENT.</em> <b>"But it's a difference between 
            black artists and wack artists."</b>

            <br><br>

            When Rolling Stone inquired about the line, he spilt. 
            
            <br><br>

            "How would I define a wack artist? A wack artist uses other people’s music for their approval. 
            We’re talking about someone that is scared to make their own voice, chases somebody else’s success and their thing, 
            but runs away from their own thing. That’s what keeps the game watered-down. Everybody’s not going to be able to be a 
            Kendrick Lamar. I’m not telling you to rap like me. Be you. Simple as that. I watch a lot of good artists go down 
            like that because you’re so focused on what numbers this guy has done, and it dampers your own creativity. 
            Which ultimately dampers the listener, because at the end of the day, it’s not for us. 
            It’s for the person driving to their 9-to-5 that don’t feel like they wanna go to work that morning."

            <br><br>

            "It's for the person driving to their 9-to-5 that don't feel like they wanna go to work that morning."

            <br><br>
        

            Ethos, Kendrick. Ethos is the gap, and it's what turns <em>LOYALTY.</em> from a pathetic, disillusioned output of music as product (à la Chris Brown),
            to that wretched dissapointment some listeners experienced. I can't stress this enough, <em>There's anger in the air,</em> and after a 
            comprehensive return to an album whose disillusionment & pessimism rival the most forward thinking parts of his past lauded works,
            that anger stands to be curbed greatly. 

            <p>
            
            In arguments about fair treatment and following law in the face of equality, there come these sort of a priori assumptions about people, 
            specifically entertainers in the same field. It's usually in these arguments that, almost always, without fail, a new variable comes into play:
            the non-tangible, <em>it-factor.</em>

            <br><br>

            The it-factor is what seperates entertainers who, by every means, stand to operate in the exact same logical spaces as one another. This is why
            the argument of Jordan vs. Lebron never boils down merely to statistics; why All Star queens in RuPaul's Drag Race raised concerns over an untouchable
            quality Alyssa Edwards had, one that seemed to pull her to safety in weeks that, at face-value, were ruts. This is why the conversation of whether Kendrick
            Lamar's status as a peerless rapper...should mostly likely end right there.

            <br><br>

            What helps elevate Kendrick Lamar's status <em>can</em> be quantified, though. In recent memory, he is perhaps one of the only artists to present
            direct attacks to a broader, reciprocal system that houses the same poverty, pain, and violence he grew around. He is an artist far removed from 
            particulars, which is why his relationship with pure evil holds so much weight.

            <br><br>
            
            "We always wonder why people act the way they're acting. We put the statistics in it and we put history behind it, but we're missing God in
            the equation. The devil is real and he's alive. Nobody ever brings that shit up."

            <br><br>

            If <em>GKMC</em> was the direct reproduction of marginalized stories, holding implicit weight against the system, & <em>TPAB</em> is the explicit & implicit 
            exercise in critiquing models of pure horror and subjugation of black bodies, <em>DAMN.</em> is a total reversion to the darkest space one
            can find themselves in amongst this pain. In fact, it's rarely touched upon that Kendrick Lamar is, at times, a <em>horrible person</em> on this album.

            <br><br>

            On <em>DNA.</em> the same man who would've posed direct condemnation against the system that pits & rewards betrayal amongst community members, likens 
            snitching to <em>genealogy.</em> Which, on one note, is hilarious. 
            
            <br><br>

            "Your hormones probably switch inside your DNA, Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA. <b>Daddy probably snitched, heritage inside your DNA.</b> Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge."

            <br><br>

            <em style="color: crimson">Damn.</em>

            <br><br>

            Where is the Imposter Syndrome? The God Complex--the dread in knowing his entire past was stuck in poverty? This guilt played a central role
            to Kendrick's discography, in fact, he dedicated two albums to it. <em>DAMN.</em> finds Kendrick reflecting on poverty for one line and proceeding to 
            "hit cartwheels in his estate."
            
            <br><br>

            If the Black Isrealite movement serves to empower Kendrick's past and lift him over systemic violence and oppression, he'd give as much as a line to the thought of it all
            on <em>YAH.</em> before he says temptation is first on his list. So forget it, and even if he's to believe in it, and believe it will lift his community, forget it.

            <br><br>

            Is <em>FEEL.</em> the deepest plunge into nihilism Kendrick has taken thus far in his career? No. It's pure bitterness. The same man who returned to 
            Compton on <em>TPAB</em>, on songs like <em>Momma</em>, is over it. "Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it, Feel like I ain't feeling you all. I feel like removin' myself, no feeling involved. <b>I feel for you, I been in the field for you, it's real for you, right.</b> Shit, I feel like ain't nobody prayin' for me." 
            It's striking how open he is in his acknowledgement and sympathy.

            <br><br>

            At this point, <em>DAMN.</em> starts to feel like a unnerving betrayal of everything Kendrick Lamar stood for.

            <br><br>
            <!--
            Take <em>PRIDE.,</em> the total renouncing of material relationships. "I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world. I don't love people enough to put my faith in man...I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid, <b>Seems like I point the finger just to make your point nowadays</b>"
                
            <br><br>
            -->
            We must return to <em>ELEMENT.,</em> specifically its key closer: "It's a difference between black artists and wack artists." That untangible "it" is, in this case,
            ethos. Within the space and point in which in this album came out, a late product of an incredibly consistent and efficient career--the career of a man whose music was
            defined by its reproducing of marginizalied stories and attacks on wide-spread symptoms of poverty and violence, even metaphysical questions of how deep the roots of racism lie--Within 
            this very space, to chalk up <em>DAMN.</em> as a mere selling out, or even an anger-inducing exercise in vanity and "me-me-me"-isms,
            is dishonest. 
            
            <br><br>

            Is there not any sort of alarm when someone hailed as a "man of the people" is suddenly over everything he stood for? There's a sort 
            of deep aloofness and unnerving anger that teeters back and forth, and the only moments of resignation into the man he "used to be" reach nowhere
            near the incredibly heavy highs he used to hold revelations in, like when we realize he was, indeed, speaking directly to God on "How Much a Dollar Cost".

            <br><br>

            <em>LUST.,</em> one of the most incredible songs of the 2010s, is perhaps Kendrick at his darkest & most uncomfortable. This is brutal detachment.
            Around halfway in the one-minute mark, before anything further begins, Kendrick detaches himself from the portrayal of whoever he's playing at the moment,
            and in between deep, naked breaths, says "Yeah, I need everybody motha' fucking hand's up right now...this that new shit...this that new new shit."

            <br><br>

            What follows is a sad, sad, sad...sad--<em>very</em> sad wagging of the finger on Kendrick's part. The motifs of cyclical boredom, short-term thinking, &
            material happiness people Kendrick would've considered peers mere years ago are blatant. And what does the first verse end on? "It's whatever, just make it count."
            Yes! The same man who dedicated an entire album to retelling the stories of his peers who seemingly led lives like this, even on previous works--consider <em>Keisha's Song</em>--isn't even going as far as condemnation, it screams of condescension.

            <br><br>

            Does it pain us collectively even further to hear his thoughts on societal and structural change? I hesistate to bring up <em>Alright</em> as
            the anthem for many Black Lives Matter protests, because these next lines are going to hurt.

            <br><br>

            "Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true.
            All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep.
            None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap.
            Still and sad, distraught and mad, <b>tell the neighbor 'bout it.
            Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly.
            Time passin', things change,
            Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways."</b>

            <br><br>

            <em style="color: crimson">DAMN.</em>
            
            </p>

            <p>

            <em>DAMN.</em> finds Kendrick Lamar sorting through particulars. He's here with the same vitriol and anger of a community he 
            spent an entire career trying to lift up. However, Kendrick's rummaging is marked through resignation, the tire of rigidity.
            One ought to step back and reassess their criticisms of an album that suggests collective mobilization towards structural 
            change is hopeless. 
            
            <br><br>

            One of many aspects behind the experience of Kendrick's old community is violence, specifically the outright response of revenge.
            In this regard, <em>XXX.</em> is indeed the peak of this album.

            <br><br>

            "I can't sugercoat the answer for you, this is how I feel: <b>If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody getting killed.</b>"

            <br><br>

            One of the most polarizing aspects of <em>TPAB,</em> an otherwise universally acclaimed album, was the infamous ending of <em>The Blacker The Berry</em>

            <br><br>

            "So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? When gang banging made me kill a nigga blacker than me? Hypocrite."

            <br><br>

            When you build your entire career with a certain thesis--When you carry the contextual weight of Kendrick Lamar--a line like this 
            enters a new discursive space. For many artists, the conversation would have both started & ended with the problematic nature of equating
            black on black violence and police brutality, but this line enters a completely new space when one discusses Kendrick in parallel with critical 
            theory. That Kendrick advocates for a completely new understanding of black ontology through reclamation, à la Toni Morrison & Alice Walker,
            is not an unwarranted take. Still, there are many factors to take into consideration, and that line alone stands await for its own discussion.

            <br><br>

            But which sorts of spaces are created on a song like <em>XXX.</em>? If it hasn't made itself clear yet, <em>DAMN.</em> is the album where Kendrick 
            Lamar returns to the same "home" he returned to in each stage of his career, it's through his outright rejection of each and every theme in 
            his past two works that an even deeper analysis of the <em>same</em> implicit, cyclical, totalitarian nexus of subjugation that's been tackled 
            throughout his entire career emerges. To say that it's subverted in any methodical or even surface-level lyrical way is strange, in that it very
            much upholds Kendrick's values of artistry. In fact, he arguably navigates them in a far more interesting manner than he's ever attempted before. Is
            there even any sort of archaic moral to uphold here? The album ends in Kendrick's revealing of his father and Top Dawg, the founder of his label, 
            having known each other before.

            <br><br>

            "Ducky was well-aware.
            They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year.
            He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides.
            Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line.
            Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide.
            They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive.
            <b>Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives.</b>
            One curse at a time,
            Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why:
            You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments.
            Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it.
            Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again.
            Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits.
            Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident.
            Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
            Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
            While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight."

            <br><br>

            Damn...it seems. A shocking revelation, a great twist, for sure. But does it match the powerful love letter to the city like 
            <em>GKMC's</em> closer: <em>Compton</em>? Does it match the overwhelming, completely unexpected narrative twist that <em>TPAB</em>
            takes in its respective end? No. Because it is not those albums. If anything, how else could have <em>DAMN.</em> ended but with a resignation, and 
            in a strange way, celebration, of secular coincidence; a "phew" that he managed to avoid the cycle of violence he so potently examined before; & an
            immediate reminder that he, in fact, didn't. In the album reversing all the way back to the beginning in mere seconds.

            </p>
            <p>

            No, I did not talk about <em>LOYALTY.</em>, <em>HUMBLE.</em>, or <em>LOVE.</em>, because they are strange songs that have little to do
            with anything. After three years, their respective standings on the album pose an uncomfortable question: Did he do it for the money? Luckily,
            <em>DAMN.</em> is an album chock full of unnerving moments, with some of its standouts ultimately filling slots in his all-time list. 
            Still, that question looms. "What could he <em>possibly</em> do next?" 
            
            <br><br>

            In presenting three strikingly different takes and experiences within
            the over-arching cycle of pain that's marked his life, Kendrick Lamar has already produced one of the greatest musical catalogues of the past few decades,
            but what's becoming far more clear, is that neither <em>TPAB</em> nor <em>DAMN.</em> were the "make or break" moments. It's that coveted fifth studio album
            that holds tremendous weight within the current picture of his legacy. Not much more to do than to wait.

        <p>“I realized that Joyce had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, 
            in control of one's material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his 
            proofs to see that. I realised that my own way was impoverishment, in lack of knowledge 
            and in taking away, subtracting rather than adding. When I first met Joyce, 
            I didn't intend to be a writer. That only came later when I found out that I was 
            no good at all at teaching. When I found I simply couldn't teach. But I do remember 
            speaking about Joyce's heroic achievement. I had a great admiration for him. 
            That's what it was: epic, heroic, what he achieved. I realized that I couldn't 
            go down that same road.” <em>Samuel Beckett on James Joyce</em>

        <h2>Close, but Virtually, or, as Far as I'm Concerned, No--<em>and I can't stress this enough</em>--Cigar</h2>
        <p>by Yousef Fatehpour</p>
        <p>“.@LilNasX Been watching everything going on with OTR. When I got thrown off the charts, Waylon Jennings said to me “Take this as a compliment” means you’re doing something great! Only Outlaws are outlawed. Welcome to the club!” Billy Ray Cyrus tweeted Lil Nas X, two days before the duos’ remix was released.

        <br><br>
        
        <em>”Only Outlaws are outlawed”</em>. Yes. Agreed. And it seemed for a second that the proverb Cyrus passed to his junior was, for once, genuine. The case of <em>Old Town Road</em> follows the trend most cultural takes have, in that they’re true—kind of, not really.
        
        
        </p>

        <p>
        The question of what art <em>is</em> has daunted the philosophical and literary world for generations, and some hags, as well. Unsurprisingly, the new era of utility has killed it, which is very good. If it is meaningless, it must not matter. This is the contemporary rationality many facets of the world build their theses around, It’s precisely this utilitarianism that many young and aspiring artists find as a goal to overcome. There is <b>always</b> a goal. Rationality, and the contemporary dependence on utilitarianism have both killed the ontological question of art, and given life to new artistry.
        
        <br><br>
        
        This life is propelled towards belonging, and most successful, contemporary, Western art, has found its message in belonging. Either through a deep meditation and translation of the artist’s immediate experiences and pain, or through the trail-blazing, revolutionary boundaries an artist is willing to destroy. Both points are important, because they both find their weight in creating new spaces, respectively. 
        
        <br><br>
        
        The artist who translates their experiences speaks to the marginalized. This ranges from the emotionally distraught (of all ages, from frivolous to devastating), who crave a certain type of art to compliment their certain type of feeling, to our normal definition of the marginalized—actual people who have had, for political reasons, their voices actively suppressed.
        
        <br><br>
        
        The second group is far more applicable to our framework than the first, because the emotionally distraught find an immediate space for their personal wellbeing, and the politically marginalized are created a space <em>within</em> the very industry that works in the nexus of their historical suppression. Both fall in line with our argument about utility and the active goal of the artist carving out spaces, but the second is far more telling of the danger this new era of utility has imposed. But, for now, look at this big black text: <b>The artist who translates their experiences does so in the pursuit of creating a space for the people.</b> 
        
        <br><br>
        
        The artist who strives to destroy all traditions and shatter expectations—well, first and foremost, must do so for some reason. All else is vanity, otherwise. This is a very contentious point, I think, because the notion of creating art for art’s sake and plunging into pure prettiness is very popular these days. But it seems that even then, the artist builds themselves on a thesis, and even the atheist does as well. It’s the <b>agnostic</b> artist who seems to be the most…mid. In the complete denial of art’s relationship with utility, the artist builds a necessary thesis behind their work, as to not come off as a watermelon.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Regardless, once that is ticked, the technically revolutionary artist ALWAYS finds themselves at the forefront of a tired conversation, one that is ESPECIALLY tired in the cinematic world: The artist as <em>the diamond in the rough.</em>
        
        <br><br>
        
        I want to be honest and say I am struggling in this section to use non-binary pronouns, because I have never seen a woman filmmaker in this position. The male director is the epitome of the artistic legume.
        
        <br><br>
        
        <b>The artist who defines their career through subversion and non-traditionalist values does so in the pursuit of creating a space for the artist.</b>
        
        <br><br>
        
        And so what of the transcendental nature of art? A revalation: I used to think you must be a very wrinkly person if the metaphysical question of aesthetics still bothers you, but is this not only a side-effect of having an ounce of faith in the very real notion that art can transcend all materiality? Yes, it is. And No, also. No, it is not transcendent. All art falls under the umbrella of utility, because all meaningful art has a thesis, and agnostic art is very clearly, to all of us, evil art. It’s only the notion that this sort of art is in some way spiritually evil or lacking in morality that is archaic.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Agnostic art is art that rarely bothers to ponder the question of its weaponization.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Because all art is weaponization, that is the fundamental utilitarian end for every single piece of distributed art. If it is not met, it simply did not see the light of day. 
        <br><br>

        <img src="blogpics/patrick.png" alt="Get on with it.">
        
        <br><br>
        
        The fundamental issue with saying all art is due for weaponization lies in the fact that I am listening to music as I type drivel, and I direct movies, and I enjoy television. So immediately, I am far more optimistic than the theorists I draw from.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Ok, next issue: If all art is weaponization, and I’m to deny the blind-sighted carving out of political spaces within the very sphere that has pummeled my kind systemically, then A. This system is <em>far</em> more abstract than the blanket “deep-state”, cyberpunk, global-conspiracy world I scratched my belly to, and B. There is legitimately no way to achieve <em>anything</em> in the midst of this self-serving abomination of an industry. 
        
        <br><br>
        
        These are critical points that condense and even mutate, abysmally for some, decades of cultural theory, and my goal right now is not to expound on each individual facet, but rather get to the point.
        
        <br><br>
        
        <em>Old Town Road</em> was created on the same technical principles the new era of music is starting to find as law. Even amongst conversations with technically skilled professionals in the field, there is an insistence on mixing and mastering music with accessibility in mind, so that all devices are taken into consideration. This is the sort of utility one hears in the Design sphere, and it’s honorable that that sort of relationship with equipment has a very distinct section within the music world. Auteur theory serves as the counterpart to this categorical approach to physically producing art, because the ghoul who’s in charge of the “crew” insists on mixing the spirit of the engineer with the rank stench of the screenwriter.
        
        <br><br>
        
        I hope to bring into the forefront just how important the physical ease of creating <em>Old Town Road</em> was in its success. When I say success, I do not in anyway mean to applaud its marketability or ultimate profit value, but its success in making Billboard, <b>a facet of the musical culture industry that reflexively feeds the very system that runs it, thus creating a space where the industry and only the industry have the power of to capture and appropriate the ends of art,</b> muster up a second of confusion and cover up a frivolous matter of semantics.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Billboard’s controversial, and I should reiterate, <em>secret</em>, decision to take <em>Old Town Road</em> off the country charts lost its power when it the conversation was immediately pulled to the base question of utility—the blind sighted artist’s question utility, that is—<em>We do what we do because we have systematically not been allowed to operate in these spaces, and that’s bullshit.</em> And it is, without a doubt, bullshit. But more on that after this.
        
        <br><br>
        
        The power of its ever so slight crack into a facet of the culture industry proves itself…recursively. It is in the sentence alone. Billboard is seen as the archaic “other” that the bedroom musician either infiltrated or never cared about in the first place. And it very much is that “other” now. Make no mistake, the bottom-up success of the bedroom/Soundcloud artist has found its success <em>only</em> through these archaic facets of the culture industry (i.e. the radio, charting), but that does not mean it’s not a success, and that does not mean it can’t tap into the same pressure <em>Old Town Road</em> did.
        
        <br><br>
        
        The third, amongst many, issue that is raised is the obvious ignorance this stance seems to have towards the very real issue of marginalization and the successes that spring from the goal of overcoming it. I could turn it into a grand issue the way I’d turn the success of women’s suffrage into the [hopeful(?)] impetus: “Why did it take so long, and why did we need to go through <em>you</em> to get it done?” But it got done, and it had to have got done, because a very explicit domination would have continued to precede. So…fuck.
        
        <br><br>
        
        “Only Outlaws are outlawed” Waylon Jennings told Cyrus decades ago. The world is so sickeningly evil. The official remix to <em>Old Town Road</em> rolled out, and so did numerous other remixes. To top this off, Lil Nas X performed at multiple award shows fully embracing the identity he was quietly, in a pathetic attempt, stripped of for a millisecond. It’s the return to the way things were in the year-long rollout that followed, that seemed normal, of all things. I say normal fully aware of his performing in various neon colored cowboy suits.

        <h2>The Fine Line Between Pestilence and Pride</h2>
        <p>by Yoni Yardeni</p>
        <p>Stumbling on the window of opportunity to jaywalk was once a sentiment. I liked to believe it fell on the cusp of god sent. Now, accounting for the fact that most of the roads are essentially empty everywhere you turn your head, it has jokingly become the safer route as to when compared to strolling a sidewalk accompanied by other humans. At least that’s what nearly everything makes it out to be.
            <br><br>

            Come the dead center of last month, landing that chance to zoom across the street unscathed didn’t even seem like a challenge anymore. Prior, you needed to keep your head on a swivel, as those ten seconds where you hesitantly plant your right foot down, look left to see if a car will potentially tear you up limb-by-limb, right to see if anyone is looking at you like “this motherfucker,” then left once again to confirm you’ll remain intact before you make way were, more often than not, an indescribably invigorating ten seconds. Indescribable because it’s so mundane unless you get hit or some shit, and invigorating because you have to run; otherwise, you’ll get hit or some shit.
            <br><br>
            
            In theory, jaywalking hones an underlying sense of narcissism that can only be understood when accounting for the self-absorption it takes to pull it off. Disregarding the legal aspect, as I like to think it’s far more acceptable to believe you’re above the law than your average guy on the street, having the thought instilled that where you have to be is important enough to potentially interrupt the flow of traffic seems pretty damn vain. Then again, you know what else is considered vain nowadays?
            <br><br>
            
            Going outside.
            <br><br>
            
            Now being the block’s hottest commodity, and that goes for every single block, the number of societal distrusts you could be involved in that doesn’t include simply leaving your house has grown scarce... which is stupid. But, I get it, because precaution falls above all else. Wearing gloves and a mask in this climate is akin to those ten seconds of prepping yourself before running across the street because, somehow, we’re at a point that has put forth the idea that contact with the wrong person’s hand can be as deadly as contact with oncoming traffic. 
            <br><br>
            
            The streets are emptier than I have ever seen them, drawing parallels with half of the aisles in local grocery stores I’ve stepped foot in. But, and this is where that line I mentioned falls in place, who the fuck cares? 
            <br><br>
            
            Are you as sick of it as I am? 
            <br><br>
            
            I’m not asking whether you’re sick of the updates, because they are vital. At least, somewhat, right? Vital enough for people bored enough at home feeling the need to play doctor as they peruse through piles of staggering stats they like to act will make a difference in how they manage time around their house all day. Though, in real-time, these numbers are in flux by the millisecond and hold little to no significant weight.

            I’m not asking whether you’re sick of the propagandistic paper-towels-are-flying-off-the-shelves-so-you-need-to-go-to-Target-but-also-need-to-stay-home-at-all-costs-bullshit, either, because who in their right mind isn’t?

            I’m questioning if you’re sick of the panic. The soulless glare from your parents, partner, roommate or whoever you find yourself beside when you let out the most nanoscopic cough your body has ever emitted. "Are you feeling anything else?". "Have you washed your hands?". “You hear it stays on cardboard?”. "200,000 people are going to die next week." And, the worst one by a mile, "Are you coughing?".
            <br><br>
            
            NO! I! AM! NOT! COUGHING! I! JUST! FUCKING! COUGHED!

            Amidst the stupid questions, shrewd looks, and Facebook-headline-Esque instillments of paranoia, I've still been going to the market. I've still been going to the bank if I need the cash. I've still dapped up my delivery drivers. Maybe it is because I am smart enough to multitask. I can take a step outside, but I can also wear gloves at the same time; atop of this, I can wear a mask! Wow! It’s almost as if I’m taking the essential shit that the news has been telling everybody into account!

            The stay inside stuff is annoying. Sensible, but annoying nonetheless. What do you deem as essential? I often claimed a slice of Napoleon cake from Gelson’s an essential, maybe even a cannoli; but, there I was, being flamed and called an idiot by half of my friends simply because I decided to go to the fucking market for my fix for a cream filled pastry. (pauselol)

            Another unnecessary storyline that people have made out of this, that find hilarious, is how people think this quarantine shit has evolved into an excuse for everybody to answer their phone promptly, as if I wasn’t capable of getting distracted by the most irrelevant thing in the room dating back to the start of this new decade. I’ve often been a pretty shitty responder, and it’s bewildering to think that being stuck inside the house all day has made me worse of one.

            And I hate to sound like an ignorant ass because, TRUST ME, I understand the magnitude of it all. It’s junctures like this that go to show how human we all are. That no one is above anyone else, all that introspective we-are-more-than-our-outer-shell blah blah blah, aside from professional basketball players. Talk about star treatment. You mean to tell me Dante Exum had the better shot of getting tested than my dad who was coming out of the I.C.U a couple of days before Mayor Garcetti imposed the whole “Safer at Home” thing? Man, fuck Dante Exum.

            If this comes off as scattered to you, then take it at as at glance at what the inside of my head has looked like since it registered that everything had gone on pause. I started writing a couple of other things but scrapped it in favor of this. Time will tell if I should’ve done so with this. Considering the way I see it would be terrible guidance to give children, then time will likely let out a resounding “yes,”; regardless, in such a strange time, it is the line between pestilence and pride that sways people to go outside.
