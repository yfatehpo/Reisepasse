        <h2>Green In Your Own Way.</h2>
        <p>“I realized that Joyce had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, 
            in control of one's material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his 
            proofs to see that. I realised that my own way was impoverishment, in lack of knowledge 
            and in taking away, subtracting rather than adding. When I first met Joyce, 
            I didn't intend to be a writer. That only came later when I found out that I was 
            no good at all at teaching. When I found I simply couldn't teach. But I do remember 
            speaking about Joyce's heroic achievement. I had a great admiration for him. 
            That's what it was: epic, heroic, what he achieved. I realized that I couldn't 
            go down that same road.” <em>Samuel Beckett on James Joyce</em>

            <br><br>

            <em>Ulysses</em>, alongside 20 other classics, are now all available on Reisepasse.

        <h2>In Regards to Overcompensation</h2>    
        <p>It has, no doubt, been a rewarding and successful first week for Reisepasse. It's best that instead of demarcating 
            x amount of books per week/month/etc., we focus on releasing batches of texts, with a loose goal of one text per day 
            to not overshoot anything.
            <br><br>
            For now, we're sticking with our theme of getting half-classics/half-stuff-we-love out the way, as you'll see with the 
            upcoming batch of texts below, but afterwards, we'll be experimenting with themed releases. Stay tuned for Plato-Week, 
            Classic-British-Women-Writers-Part-Of-Amazing-Literary-Families-Week, and Tome-Week, where we'll be distributing the entirity of
            the works of William Shakespeare, the full Divine Comedy, and <em><b>the entirity of Rememberance of Things Past!</b></em> In a single 
            ePub!
            <br><br>
            Until then, check out the upcoming batch we plan on rolling out in the following weeks.

        <h2>Close, but Virtually, or, as Far as I'm Concerned, No--<em>and I can't stress this enough</em>--Cigar</h2>
        <p>by Yousef Fatehpour</p>
        <p>“.@LilNasX Been watching everything going on with OTR. When I got thrown off the charts, Waylon Jennings said to me “Take this as a compliment” means you’re doing something great! Only Outlaws are outlawed. Welcome to the club!” Billy Ray Cyrus tweeted Lil Nas X, two days before the duos’ remix was released.

        <br><br>
        
        <em>”Only Outlaws are outlawed”</em>. Yes. Agreed. And it seemed for a second that the proverb Cyrus passed to his junior was, for once, genuine. The case of <em>Old Town Road</em> follows the trend most cultural takes have, in that they’re true—kind of, not really.
        
        
        </p>

        <p>
        The question of what art <em>is</em> has daunted the philosophical and literary world for generations, and some hags, as well. Unsurprisingly, the new era of utility has killed it, which is very good. If it is meaningless, it must not matter. This is the contemporary rationality many facets of the world build their theses around, It’s precisely this utilitarianism that many young and aspiring artists find as a goal to overcome. There is <b>always</b> a goal. Rationality, and the contemporary dependence on utilitarianism have both killed the ontological question of art, and given life to new artistry.
        
        <br><br>
        
        This life is propelled towards belonging, and most successful, contemporary, Western art, has found its message in belonging. Either through a deep meditation and translation of the artist’s immediate experiences and pain, or through the trail-blazing, revolutionary boundaries an artist is willing to destroy. Both points are important, because they both find their weight in creating new spaces, respectively. 
        
        <br><br>
        
        The artist who translates their experiences speaks to the marginalized. This ranges from the emotionally distraught (of all ages, from frivolous to devastating), who crave a certain type of art to compliment their certain type of feeling, to our normal definition of the marginalized—actual people who have had, for political reasons, their voices actively suppressed.
        
        <br><br>
        
        The second group is far more applicable to our framework than the first, because the emotionally distraught find an immediate space for their personal wellbeing, and the politically marginalized are created a space <em>within</em> the very industry that works in the nexus of their historical suppression. Both fall in line with our argument about utility and the active goal of the artist carving out spaces, but the second is far more telling of the danger this new era of utility has imposed. But, for now, look at this big black text: <b>The artist who translates their experiences does so in the pursuit of creating a space for the people.</b> 
        
        <br><br>
        
        The artist who strives to destroy all traditions and shatter expectations—well, first and foremost, must do so for some reason. All else is vanity, otherwise. This is a very contentious point, I think, because the notion of creating art for art’s sake and plunging into pure prettiness is very popular these days. But it seems that even then, the artist builds themselves on a thesis, and even the atheist does as well. It’s the <b>agnostic</b> artist who seems to be the most…mid. In the complete denial of art’s relationship with utility, the artist builds a necessary thesis behind their work, as to not come off as a watermelon.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Regardless, once that is ticked, the technically revolutionary artist ALWAYS finds themselves at the forefront of a tired conversation, one that is ESPECIALLY tired in the cinematic world: The artist as <em>the diamond in the rough.</em>
        
        <br><br>
        
        I want to be honest and say I am struggling in this section to use non-binary pronouns, because I have never seen a woman filmmaker in this position. The male director is the epitome of the artistic legume.
        
        <br><br>
        
        <b>The artist who defines their career through subversion and non-traditionalist values does so in the pursuit of creating a space for the artist.</b>
        
        <br><br>
        
        And so what of the transcendental nature of art? A revalation: I used to think you must be a very wrinkly person if the metaphysical question of aesthetics still bothers you, but is this not only a side-effect of having an ounce of faith in the very real notion that art can transcend all materiality? Yes, it is. And No, also. No, it is not transcendent. All art falls under the umbrella of utility, because all meaningful art has a thesis, and agnostic art is very clearly, to all of us, evil art. It’s only the notion that this sort of art is in some way spiritually evil or lacking in morality that is archaic.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Agnostic art is art that rarely bothers to ponder the question of its weaponization.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Because all art is weaponization, that is the fundamental utilitarian end for every single piece of distributed art. If it is not met, it simply did not see the light of day. 
        <br><br>

        <img src="blogpics/patrick.png" alt="Get on with it.">
        
        <br><br>
        
        The fundamental issue with saying all art is due for weaponization lies in the fact that I am listening to music as I type drivel, and I direct movies, and I enjoy television. So immediately, I am far more optimistic than the theorists I draw from.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Ok, next issue: If all art is weaponization, and I’m to deny the blind-sighted carving out of political spaces within the very sphere that has pummeled my kind systemically, then A. This system is <em>far</em> more abstract than the blanket “deep-state”, cyberpunk, global-conspiracy world I scratched my belly to, and B. There is legitimately no way to achieve <em>anything</em> in the midst of this self-serving abomination of an industry. 
        
        <br><br>
        
        These are critical points that condense and even mutate, abysmally for some, decades of cultural theory, and my goal right now is not to expound on each individual facet, but rather get to the point.
        
        <br><br>
        
        <em>Old Town Road</em> was created on the same technical principles the new era of music is starting to find as law. Even amongst conversations with technically skilled professionals in the field, there is an insistence on mixing and mastering music with accessibility in mind, so that all devices are taken into consideration. This is the sort of utility one hears in the Design sphere, and it’s honorable that that sort of relationship with equipment has a very distinct section within the music world. Auteur theory serves as the counterpart to this categorical approach to physically producing art, because the ghoul who’s in charge of the “crew” insists on mixing the spirit of the engineer with the rank stench of the screenwriter.
        
        <br><br>
        
        I hope to bring into the forefront just how important the physical ease of creating <em>Old Town Road</em> was in its success. When I say success, I do not in anyway mean to applaud its marketability or ultimate profit value, but its success in making Billboard, <b>a facet of the musical culture industry that reflexively feeds the very system that runs it, thus creating a space where the industry and only the industry have the power of to capture and appropriate the ends of art,</b> muster up a second of confusion and cover up a frivolous matter of semantics.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Billboard’s controversial, and I should reiterate, <em>secret</em>, decision to take <em>Old Town Road</em> off the country charts lost its power when it the conversation was immediately pulled to the base question of utility—the blind sighted artist’s question utility, that is—<em>We do what we do because we have systematically not been allowed to operate in these spaces, and that’s bullshit.</em> And it is, without a doubt, bullshit. But more on that after this.
        
        <br><br>
        
        The power of its ever so slight crack into a facet of the culture industry proves itself…recursively. It is in the sentence alone. Billboard is seen as the archaic “other” that the bedroom musician either infiltrated or never cared about in the first place. And it very much is that “other” now. Make no mistake, the bottom-up success of the bedroom/Soundcloud artist has found its success <em>only</em> through these archaic facets of the culture industry (i.e. the radio, charting), but that does not mean it’s not a success, and that does not mean it can’t tap into the same pressure <em>Old Town Road</em> did.
        
        <br><br>
        
        The third, amongst many, issue that is raised is the obvious ignorance this stance seems to have towards the very real issue of marginalization and the successes that spring from the goal of overcoming it. I could turn it into a grand issue the way I’d turn the success of women’s suffrage into the [hopeful(?)] impetus: “Why did it take so long, and why did we need to go through <em>you</em> to get it done?” But it got done, and it had to have got done, because a very explicit domination would have continued to precede. So…fuck.
        
        <br><br>
        
        “Only Outlaws are outlawed” Waylon Jennings told Cyrus decades ago. The world is so sickeningly evil. The official remix to <em>Old Town Road</em> rolled out, and so did numerous other remixes. To top this off, Lil Nas X performed at multiple award shows fully embracing the identity he was quietly, in a pathetic attempt, stripped of for a millisecond. It’s the return to the way things were in the year-long rollout that followed, that seemed normal, of all things. I say normal fully aware of his performing in various neon colored cowboy suits.

        <h2>The Fine Line Between Pestilence and Pride</h2>
        <p>by Yoni Yardeni</p>
        <p>Stumbling on the window of opportunity to jaywalk was once a sentiment. I liked to believe it fell on the cusp of god sent. Now, accounting for the fact that most of the roads are essentially empty everywhere you turn your head, it has jokingly become the safer route as to when compared to strolling a sidewalk accompanied by other humans. At least that’s what nearly everything makes it out to be.
            <br><br>

            Come the dead center of last month, landing that chance to zoom across the street unscathed didn’t even seem like a challenge anymore. Prior, you needed to keep your head on a swivel, as those ten seconds where you hesitantly plant your right foot down, look left to see if a car will potentially tear you up limb-by-limb, right to see if anyone is looking at you like “this motherfucker,” then left once again to confirm you’ll remain intact before you make way were, more often than not, an indescribably invigorating ten seconds. Indescribable because it’s so mundane unless you get hit or some shit, and invigorating because you have to run; otherwise, you’ll get hit or some shit.

            In theory, jaywalking hones an underlying sense of narcissism that can only be understood when accounting for the self-absorption it takes to pull it off. Disregarding the legal aspect, as I like to think it’s far more acceptable to believe you’re above the law than your average guy on the street, having the thought instilled that where you have to be is important enough to potentially interrupt the flow of traffic seems pretty damn vain. Then again, you know what else is considered vain nowadays?

            Going outside.
            <br><br>
            
            Now being the block’s hottest commodity, and that goes for every single block, the number of societal distrusts you could be involved in that doesn’t include simply leaving your house has grown scarce... which is stupid. But, I get it, because precaution falls above all else. Wearing gloves and a mask in this climate is akin to those ten seconds of prepping yourself before running across the street because, somehow, we’re at a point that has put forth the idea that contact with the wrong person’s hand can be as deadly as contact with oncoming traffic.

            The streets are emptier than I have ever seen them, drawing parallels with half of the aisles in local grocery stores I’ve stepped foot in. But, and this is where that line I mentioned falls in place, who the fuck cares?

            Are you as sick of it as I am? 
            <br><br>
            
            I’m not asking whether you’re sick of the updates, because they are vital. At least, somewhat, right? Vital enough for people bored enough at home feeling the need to play doctor as they peruse through piles of staggering stats they like to act will make a difference in how they manage time around their house all day. Though, in real-time, these numbers are in flux by the millisecond and hold little to no significant weight.

            I’m not asking whether you’re sick of the propagandistic paper-towels-are-flying-off-the-shelves-so-you-need-to-go-to-Target-but-also-need-to-stay-home-at-all-costs-bullshit, either, because who in their right mind isn’t? 
            <br><br>
            
            I’m questioning if you’re sick of the panic. The soulless glare from your parents, partner, roommate or whoever you find yourself beside when you let out the most nanoscopic cough your body has ever emitted. "Are you feeling anything else?". "Have you washed your hands?". “You hear it stays on cardboard?”. "200,000 people are going to die next week." And, the worst one by a mile, "Are you coughing?".
            <br><br>
            
            NO! I! AM! NOT! COUGHING! I! JUST! FUCKING! COUGHED!

            Amidst the stupid questions, shrewd looks, and Facebook-headline-Esque instillments of paranoia, I've still been going to the market. I've still been going to the bank if I need the cash. I've still dapped up my delivery drivers. Maybe it is because I am smart enough to multitask. I can take a step outside, but I can also wear gloves at the same time; atop of this, I can wear a mask! Wow! It’s almost as if I’m taking the essential shit that the news has been telling everybody into account!
            <br><br>
            
            The stay inside stuff is annoying. Sensible, but annoying nonetheless. What do you deem as essential? I often claimed a slice of Napoleon cake from Gelson’s an essential, maybe even a cannoli; but, there I was, being flamed and called an idiot by half of my friends simply because I decided to go to the fucking market for my fix for a cream filled pastry. (pauselol)

            Another unnecessary storyline that people have made out of this, that find hilarious, is how people think this quarantine shit has evolved into an excuse for everybody to answer their phone promptly, as if I wasn’t capable of getting distracted by the most irrelevant thing in the room dating back to the start of this new decade. I’ve often been a pretty shitty responder, and it’s bewildering to think that being stuck inside the house all day has made me worse of one. 
            <br><br>
            
            
            And I hate to sound like an ignorant ass because, TRUST ME, I understand the magnitude of it all. It’s junctures like this that go to show how human we all are. That no one is above anyone else, all that introspective we-are-more-than-our-outer-shell blah blah blah, aside from professional basketball players. Talk about star treatment. You mean to tell me Dante Exum had the better shot of getting tested than my dad who was coming out of the I.C.U a couple of days before Mayor Garcetti imposed the whole “Safer at Home” thing? Man, fuck Dante Exum.

            If this comes off as scattered to you, then take it at as at glance at what the inside of my head has looked like since it registered that everything had gone on pause. I started writing a couple of other things but scrapped it in favor of this. Time will tell if I should’ve done so with this. Considering the way I see it would be terrible guidance to give children, then time will likely let out a resounding “yes,”; regardless, in such a strange time, it is the line between pestilence and pride that sways people to go outside.
